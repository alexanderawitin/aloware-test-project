### Exam Notes:

#### Write a website comment system with [Laravel](https://laravel.com) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) with the following rules:
 
- Only the name and comment are required fields.
- The page should not refresh when posting a comment.
- Commenters can write a reply to other comments.
- Maximum of 3 levels in nested comments
- Order the comments by post date (within the same level)
- Should filter out malicious text that could result in a security vulnerability
- It doesn't need to be beautiful, but also shouldn't make our eyes hurt.
- No need to implement edit, delete, moderation & login
- It's up to you to decide how the comments are stored and what libraries you use.
- You'll have two days to finish this small project.
 
 
#### What we are looking for (in order of importance):

- Working code that meets our requirements
- Clean and readable code
- Organization of business logic that makes sense and is maintainable
- Documentation, when helpful
- Unit tests, if you're up for it.


#### Here are a few notes:

- If you have questions/comments, please reply to me.
- Start an empty repository on GitHub, commit base laravel to the master branch, and then start work (so when we read your code, we can separate it from Laravel base code).
- The project has to be on Laravel 5.5+ and VueJS. 
- Don't overcomplicate it :) No need for any user login. 
- You don't need to create a User or Post model. Only the comment model is enough. Assume you have one post.
